# Deep Learning Exercises

Welcome to the Deep Learning Exercises GitHub repository! This repository contains a collection of exercises and solutions for common and popular deep learning problems, all implemented using TensorFlow. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn about deep learning or an experienced practitioner seeking practical examples, this repository has you covered.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to provide exercises and solutions for various deep learning tasks. The main directory structure is as follows:

### Exercise Directories

Each exercise is located in its respective directory. These exercises cover a wide range of topics, including:

- **Digit Classification**
- **Image Classification**
- **and more...**

Inside each exercise directory, you'll typically find:

- **Jupyter Notebook**: A notebook containing the exercise description, code, and placeholders for your solutions.
- **Solution**: A separate notebook or code file that provides the solutions to the exercise.
- **Datasets**: Any necessary datasets or links to download them.

### Dependencies

To run these exercises successfully, you'll need the following dependencies:

- **TensorFlow**: Version 2.12 (with GPU support enabled using CUDA 11.8 and cuDNN 8.6)
- **NumPy**: Version 1.25.1 (for numerical operations)
- **Other Dependencies**: Additional dependencies may be mentioned in specific exercise notebooks, so be sure to check each exercise's requirements.
